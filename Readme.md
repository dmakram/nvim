# Neovim Lua Setup

## Introduction

This is built, based on the previous version of our vim-neovim, [Pineal Developers - Development Guide](https://pinealdevelopers.com/pinealdevelopers/development-guide/src/branch/main).
The Idea was to make it as close as possible and there are more things I will be adding soon.

It is a quick and simple way to start up with Vim/Neovim.
I made sure not to change most of the basic developer tools and UI basics, shortcuts, also a lot of inspiration from [thePrimeagen](https://github.com/theprimeagen)

## This is how I like my Editor

It took a while to get this configuration file to be working like this I will soon be adding a lot of documenting. To show new Users how to start of using this and editing to make their own.
